# Nishant Shukla — Deep Tech Blog

A personal research-oriented blog focused on **distributed systems, deep learning infrastructure, databases for ML, and theoretical foundations of modern machine learning**.

Built with **Next.js (App Router)** and designed to be minimal, readable, and extensible for long-form technical writing.

##  About

This blog serves as a public research notebook where I write and curate notes on:

- Distributed systems for large-scale ML
- Deep learning theory & optimization
- Transformer architectures
- Databases for ML workloads
- Fault tolerance, scalability, and systems–theory intersections

I am particularly interested in **hallucinations in LLMs**, and I am currently grinding **DSA and competitive programming** alongside research-oriented learning.

##  Content Structure

The blog currently organizes ideas around the following research themes:

1. **Distributed Systems & Deep Learning Infrastructure**
2. **Database Architecture for ML Workloads**
3. **Transformer Architecture Foundations**
4. **Deep Learning Theory & Optimization**
5. **Cross-Cutting Systems–Theory Problems**

Each section contains well-defined problem statements intended for deep exploration and future long-form articles.
